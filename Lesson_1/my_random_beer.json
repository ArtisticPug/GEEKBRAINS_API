The malty sweetness of a Weizenbock is balanced with a clove-like phenolic and fruity-estery banana element to produce a wellrounded aroma and flavor. As is true with all German wheat beers, hop bitterness is low and carbonation is high. Hop flavor and aroma are absent. It has a medium to full body. If dark, a mild roast malt character should emerge in flavor and to a lesser degree in the aroma. If this is served with yeast the beer may be appropriately very cloudy. No diacetyl should be perceived.", "ibuMin": "15", "ibuMax": "35", "abvMin": "6.9", "abvMax": "9.3", "srmMin": "5", "srmMax": "30", "ogMin": "1.066", "fgMin": "1.016", "fgMax": "1.028", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:30:15"}}, "status": "success"}
